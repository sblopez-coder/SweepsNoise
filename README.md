# SweepsNoise
SweepsNoise.py was created by Sara Lopez at the SQMS Center during the 2024 Summer Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI)

The Superconducting Qubits Training Program was begun by Ben Blowers of the 2021 Summer Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) 
with parameters.py, main.py, and sweeps.py sections

Please read Decoherence Noise on the Superconducting Qubits Training Program by Sara Lopez to gain further understanding on the importance of quantum computing, qubits, superconducting qubits, open and closed quantum systems, Jaynes-Cumming Hamiltonian, Decoherence Noise, and Resonant/Dispersive Regime. These are instrumental to understanding the simulation.

In addition to this a SweepsNoise.py Guide was created by Sara Lopez

My preliminary knowledge before beginning this internship was basic college-level physics and linear algebra - a beginner in quantum mechanics
